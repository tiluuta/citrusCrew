                That's why Keyring is here. Whether you're a college student, live in an apartment, or work in an
                office space, you probably use a keycard everyday. With Keyring, you won't have to worry about
                forgetting your keycard and getting locked out of the spaces most important to you.

                <p class="bigt">Mission Statement</p>
                <p>KeyRing is a wearable device that aims to provide users with more convenient and efficient access to
                    their living spaces and facilities. KeyRing implements RFID technology into discreet wearable accessories. Our main product is our ring,
                    but we are also developing a bracelet. These accessories can technically be used for anything that
                    uses RFID (tracking, payment, etc.) but we will focus on scannable keycards.</p>
                
                <p class="bigt">Target Market</p>
                <p>We have identified three target segments that frequently have to use keycards. The first is college
                    students as modern day colleges move towards implementing RFID technology on their campuses. For
                    example, students may need a keycard to enter their dorm. Especially for students that frequent
                    outings, we provided an added level of convenience and security in case they lose their wallet or
                    keycard. The second is apartment occupants who also have to use keycards to enter their building.
                    One case in which our products would be especially useful is if the user is carrying a lot of
                    groceries, or making multiple rounds, and would rather not constantly put everything down to take
                    out their card. The third is in-person company offices as more and more spaces move to providing
                    their employees with keycards to access the office.</p>
                <p class="bigt">Industry</p>
                <p>Although we make accessories, KeyRing is primarily focused on breaking into the technology industry
                    rather than fashion. This is because we established our main focus to be on making our products
                    efficient and useful, prioritizing discreteness over fashionability.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <br>
        <div class="whitecontainer">
          <p class="bigt">Phase 1, 2, and Beyond.</p>
          <br>
            <p style="width: 50%;">
              KeyRing has successfully created our ring and is working to develop our bracelet. We did this through 3D printing models, creating molds out of them, customizing our chips from a Chinese supplier, and inserting those chips into resin in our molds. We have made 25 sales, but these sales were fulfilled when we were still focused on developing the productâ€”now that we have a streamlined development process, we can accelerate our sales and are projected to sell 5,000 units by the end of our first year. 
            </p>
            <p style="width: 50%;">
              These profits can then be used to integrate a proper manufacturing process, such as injection molding and begin mass production. This will also allow us to scale to be both a B2B and B2C. We should also primarily focus on research and development to ensure the highest quality product. By nature our product will benefit a lot from word of mouth, but thus it can also be harmed if customers are unsatisfied. Thus we will continue to maintain good customer support and develop a financially feasible return policy to help reduce risk of customer dissatisfaction, which can negatively impact our growth.
