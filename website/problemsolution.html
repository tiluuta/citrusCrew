                office space, you probably use a keycard everyday. With Keyring, you won't have to worry about
                forgetting your keycard and getting locked out of the spaces most important to you.

                <p class="bigt">Mission Statement</p>
                <p>KeyRing is a wearable device that aims to provide users with more convenient and efficient access to
                    their living spaces and facilities. KeyRing implements RFID technology into discreet wearable accessories. Our main product is our ring,
                    but we are also developing a bracelet. These accessories can technically be used for anything that
                    uses RFID (tracking, payment, etc.) but we will focus on scannable keycards.</p>
                
                <p class="bigt">Target Market</p>
                <p>We have identified three target segments that frequently have to use keycards. The first is college
                    students as modern day colleges move towards implementing RFID technology on their campuses. For
                    example, students may need a keycard to enter their dorm. Especially for students that frequent
                    outings, we provided an added level of convenience and security in case they lose their wallet or
                    keycard. The second is apartment occupants who also have to use keycards to enter their building.
                    One case in which our products would be especially useful is if the user is carrying a lot of
                    groceries, or making multiple rounds, and would rather not constantly put everything down to take
                    out their card. The third is in-person company offices as more and more spaces move to providing
                    their employees with keycards to access the office.</p>
                <p class="bigt">Industry</p>
                <p>Although we make accessories, KeyRing is primarily focused on breaking into the technology industry
                    rather than fashion. This is because we established our main focus to be on making our products
                    efficient and useful, prioritizing discreteness over fashionability.</p>
                <p class="bigt">Competitors</p>
                <p>We have identified a few possible competitors in the industry. The main few are HMY RFID ring, Linq Bracelet, and some others that can be found on online marketplaces such as Amazon. We aim to target their vulnerabilities, such as that they are chunky, heavy, and may be jarring to look at. We currently have the thinnest and lightest RFID ring on the market, with a clear option to make it even more discrete. Our bracelet will also be a lot more minimalist and comfortable than the silicone options currently available. Some other related items in the market are Oura Ring and Fitbit, but such technological wearables do not necessarily align with our target segment.</p>
